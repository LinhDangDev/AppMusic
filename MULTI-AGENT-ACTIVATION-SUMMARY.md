## 🎮 How to Use the Multi-Agent System

### From This Conversation

I (main agent) can coordinate and execute tasks while communicating with specialized agents through:
1. **Delegation**: Asking specialized agents to handle tasks
2. **Orchestration**: Launching parallel research or sequential chains
3. **Reporting**: Collecting insights from agent reports
4. **Implementation**: Executing code changes and features

### Typical Workflow

```
1. You request a feature or task
   ↓
2. I analyze and create a plan
   ↓
3. Delegate to specialized agents:
   - planner: Create detailed implementation plan
   - researcher: Gather technical knowledge (3x parallel)
   - code-reviewer: Analyze current code
   ↓
4. Agents report findings
   ↓
5. I implement based on plans and reports
   ↓
6. tester: Run tests and validation
   ↓
7. code-reviewer: Final quality check
   ↓
8. git-manager: Commit and push
   ↓
9. project-manager: Update roadmap
```

### Available Commands

**Quick Start Commands** (from `./.claude/commands/`):
```
plan         → Create implementation plan
cook         → Implement feature
test         → Run test suite
fix/fast     → Quick bug fix
fix/hard     → Complex bug fix
docs/update  → Update documentation
git/cp       → Commit & push
```

## 💡 Pro Tips for Maximum Productivity

### 1. Use Parallel Execution
Request multiple researchers simultaneously:
```
"Research Flutter, TypeScript, and music APIs in parallel"
```

### 2. Chain Dependent Tasks
```
planner → researcher (feedback) → code-reviewer → implementation
```

### 3. Leverage Reports
All agent reports are saved in `./plans/reports/` with format:
```
YYMMDD-from-agent-name-to-agent-name-task-name-report.md
```

### 4. Reference Documentation
When implementing, always check:
- `./docs/code-standards.md`
- `./docs/system-architecture.md`
- `./docs/codebase-summary.md`

### 5. Use MCP Tools Strategically
- **eyes tools**: Analyze design mockups
- **hands tools**: Generate UI assets
- **mouth tools**: Create audio explanations
- **brain tools**: Complex problem analysis

A: Simply ask me in the conversation. Examples:
- "Please have docs-manager generate documentation"
- "Launch researchers in parallel to investigate..."
- "Have code-reviewer analyze the new features"

**Q: Can agents work in parallel?**
A: Yes! I can delegate multiple researchers simultaneously or run independent tasks in parallel.

**Q: How long does agent work take?**
A: Typically 5-15 minutes depending on complexity. Simple tasks are faster.

**Q: What if an agent finds issues?**
A: They report findings in `./plans/reports/`. I review and implement fixes based on recommendations.

**Q: Can I modify the multi-agent system?**
A: Agents are defined in `./.claude/agents/`. New agents can be added following the same pattern.
