# ⚡ Quick Start - Multi-Agent AppMusic Project

## 🎯 What You Have Right Now
✅ 12+ AI agents ready for coordination
✅ Complete MCP tools integration
✅ Development standards & workflows
✅ Project documentation templates

## 🚀 Start In 3 Steps

### Step 1: Request Work (Just Ask!)
```
"Generate documentation and research Flutter UI patterns"
```

### Step 2: I Coordinate Agents
- docs-manager generates docs
- researchers investigate topics
- Results saved to ./plans/

### Step 3: Review & Implement
- Check generated documentation
- Review research findings
- Implement based on recommendations

## 📋 Common Tasks

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Generate all docs | `"docs-manager: generate all documentation"` |
| Research topics | `"Launch 3 researchers to investigate..."` |
| Analyze code | `"code-reviewer: analyze current implementation"` |
| Plan features | `"planner: create implementation plan"` |
| Run tests | `"tester: run comprehensive test suite"` |
| Fix issues | `"debugger: analyze and diagnose issues"` |
| Organize git | `"git-manager: organize and commit changes"` |
| Track progress | `"project-manager: update project status"` |

## 🔥 Power Moves

```
"Launch 3 researchers in parallel:
1. Flutter UI best practices
2. TypeScript backend patterns
3. Music streaming optimization"
```

### Full Pipeline (Complete!)
```
"Run full workflow:
1. Plan feature
2. Research required topics
3. Analyze current code
4. Create implementation
5. Test solution
6. Review & commit"
```

### Quick Fixes (Immediate!)
```
"Identify and fix the top 3 issues in the codebase"
```
