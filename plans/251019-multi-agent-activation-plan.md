## 🔄 Multi-Agent Orchestration Strategy

### Tier 1: Foundation Agents (Documentation & Planning)
**Purpose**: Establish project knowledge base and planning

1. **docs-manager** agent
   - Generate: `./docs/codebase-summary.md`
   - Generate: `./docs/project-overview-pdr.md`
   - Generate: `./docs/code-standards.md`
   - Generate: `./docs/system-architecture.md`
   - Update: `./docs/project-roadmap.md`

2. **planner** agent
   - Create implementation plans for pending features
   - Research best practices for UI redesign
   - Plan git repository organization

3. Multiple **researcher** agents (parallel)
   - Research Flutter UI best practices 2025
   - Research TypeScript backend patterns
   - Research music streaming APIs & optimization

### Tier 2: Analysis Agents (Code Quality & Architecture)
**Purpose**: Understand current implementation and quality

1. **code-reviewer** agent
   - Analyze current codebase structure
   - Identify technical debt
   - Recommend improvements

2. **debugger** agent
   - Analyze failing tests and issues
   - Profile performance bottlenecks
   - Generate diagnostic reports

3. **database-admin** agent
   - Analyze database schema optimization
   - Review query performance
   - Recommend indexing strategies

### Tier 3: Execution Agents (Implementation)
**Purpose**: Execute code changes and features

1. **ui-ux-designer** agent
   - Implement UI redesign (_musium.dart components)
   - Create design guidelines
   - Generate asset recommendations

2. **Backend Developer** (main agent)
   - Implement backend features
   - Setup TypeScript migration
   - Implement payment integrations

3. **Mobile Developer** (main agent)
   - Complete Flutter UI implementation
   - Implement state management
   - Setup Firebase authentication

### Tier 4: Quality Assurance Agents
**Purpose**: Ensure quality and correctness

1. **tester** agent
   - Run comprehensive test suites
   - Generate coverage reports
   - Validate performance metrics

2. **code-reviewer** agent (final pass)
   - Final code quality review
   - Security audit
   - Performance validation

### Tier 5: Coordination Agents
**Purpose**: Track progress and manage project

1. **project-manager** agent
   - Track implementation progress
   - Update project roadmap
   - Consolidate reports
   - Manage task completion

2. **git-manager** agent
   - Organize and commit changes
   - Maintain commit standards
   - Push to remote repository
